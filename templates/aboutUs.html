    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about_us_text">At the end of December 2023, Liturgi Generator website began with a small, yet really challenging idea (at least for the developer).
        This website was made specially for KR GKI Citra 1 with the purpose of making the process of creating Liturgi easier and faster.
        It is hoped that this website is going to be useful in anyway possible.<br><br>
        (This website is still on the development process. Let me know immediately if you found any bug in the website.)
